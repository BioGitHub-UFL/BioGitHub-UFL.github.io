					What is Biogithub?
				</h1>
				<p>
					Biogithub is an open forum for graduate students to discuss and work on the 
					practical computation challenges of biological research. We meet regularly on the
					last Thursday of every month at 4:00pm in 222 Carr.
				</p>
				<br/>
				<h1>
					How do I present my research at Biogithub?
				</h1>
				<p>
					It is very easy! Open a new issue in 
					the <a href="https://github.com/BioGitHub-UFL/Meetings/issues">Meetings repository</a>.
				</p>
				<br/>
				<h1>
					I would like to learn something new and I think it is generally interesting to my colleagues.
				</h1>
				<p>
					Biogithub will organize workshops based on demand. This is about individuals pulling together to share
					their expertise with interested colleagues. If you would like to request a workshop on a particular topic
					or suggest a workshop that you feel comfortable leading, open a new issue in the
					<a href="https://github.com/BioGitHub-UFL/Workshops/issues">Workshops repository</a>. 	
				</p>
				<br/>
				<h1>
					I have a short question that I need answered quickly!
				</h1>
				<p>
					The FAQ pages is for all bits of interesting information that don't require the regular meeting 
					platform to be answered. These questions will be answered as soon as possible and are meant to build 
					a generally helpful repository. The top FAQ posts will be at the <a href="FAQ/FAQ.html">FAQ page</a>, but 
					browse the <a href="https://github.com/BioGitHub-UFL/FAQ">github repository</a> to see everything. Open an issue
					in the <a href="https://github.com/BioGitHub-UFL/FAQ/issues">FAQ repository</a> to add your question!
